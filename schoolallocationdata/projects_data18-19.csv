2660,Learning Logical Forms,ug4,1778,2018-02-15 21:28:37+00,1,"<p>One of the holy grails in computational linguistics is to achieve <br/>both the detailed levels of analyses that are only possible with <br/>hand-crafted grammars that support the construction of logical forms, <br/>while improving the robustness, and in particular, the coverage of such <br/>grammars. <br/>This project will address this goal by using supervised learning to <br/>acquire a mapping from natural language strings to their logical forms. <br/> </p><p><br/>We intend to use the Redwoods treebank for this purpose (Oepen et al, <br/>2002). This is a treebank containing sentences from scheduling <br/>dialogues, e-commerce emails, and tourism texts. Each utterance is <br/>annotated with all its possible linguistic analyses, as predicted by the<br/> English Resource Grammar (ERG, Flickinger, 2000), as well as a <br/>hand-picked preferred analysis. The syntactic analysis is based on HPSG,<br/> and there are several semantic representations that this HPSG supports, all of which are notational variants of each other.  Specifically, these include MRS (Copestake et al, 1999), DMRS (Copestake, 2009) and Semantic Dependencies (SDPs, See SEMEVAL 2015, task 18). <br/></p><p>The model we <br/>use to estimate logical forms from NL strings will not use features from<br/> the HPSG analysis, as we want the model to handle NL strings that <br/>receive no parse in the ERG.  Instead, you will adapt an existing model for learning mappings from NL strings to one of these semantic representations, using an existing model of your choice.  For instance, you could use the model of (Kwiatkowski, 2012), which has already been tested on much smaller corpora (e.g., the Geoquery corpus) to learn the MRS notations.  This model has already been used to learn logical forms look slightly different (e.g., they don't underspecify semantic scope).  <br/> </p><p>Kwiatkowski's model exploits the transparent<br/>syntax/semantics interface of CCG to learn string to logical form <br/>mappings.  In essence, the task of deriving a logical form for a <br/>sentence boils down to the task of supertagging.  But so far, this model<br/> has been tested on very simple linguistic phenomena on small corpora <br/>(Geoquery and ATIS).  These corpora don't contain several kinds of long <br/>distance dependencies that appear with relative frequency in Redwoods.  <br/>And although Geoquery contains a small number of sentences that feature <br/>control, the logical forms that are assigned to them abstract away from <br/>this.  So this project will test whether Kwiatkowski's model can scale to more complex NL phenomena. <br/></p><p>Adaptation<br/> of the model to the Redwoods treebank involves writing a CCG lexicon <br/>that supports underspecifying quantifier scope, in contrast to the model <br/>used for Geoquery and ATIS, where the target logical forms fully specify<br/> semantic scope. </p><p><br/>To evaluate the system we will use a combination of (a) an unseen <br/>portion of the Redwoods corpus (i.e., a set of strings which is covered <br/>by the ERG), and perhaps also (b) a set of NL examples which aren't covered by the <br/>ERG (e.g., <em>I man came in who I met</em>), for which we <br/>semi-automatically constrruct and MRS for representing its meaning.  We <br/>can use existing evaluation metrics for comparing RMRSs to MRSs for <br/>assessing the quality of the results of our model on this test corpus.</p>",To implement and test an existing model of semantic parsing on the Redwoods corpus,2,4 - Very Hard,The student should deliver the following: (i) the design of a model for learning logical forms; (ii) an implementation of this model; (iii) evaluation of the model against held-out test data from the Redwoods corpus.,6,0,f

2873,Modelling Biological Systems as Communicating Processes,ug4,1367,2018-03-03 16:24:34+00,1,"<p>The Continuous pi-Calculus (c-pi) is a process algebra for modelling behaviour and variation in biochemical systems.  Essentially, it is a programming language to describe interacting processes from molecular biology.  Key features are its expressive succinctness; a dynamic communication topology between process elements; and a mathematical semantics in ordinary differential equations (ODEs).<br/><br/>There is an accompanying <em>Logic of Behaviour in Context</em> (LBC) which expresses possible properties of these processes as they react over time.  Once a biological system has a description in c-pi, it is possible to automatically check whether or not it exhibits those properties: applying the technique of <em>model-checking</em> from hardware and software verification to investigate biochemistry.<br/><br/>This language and its logic are the subject of current research in Edinburgh, with examples from systems biology and tools for simulation and analysis.  There are multiple undergraduate and MSc students currently working on c-pi projects, and this project builds on those.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to design and build continuous pi models for a range of biochemical systems, exploring the possibilities and limitations of the calculus. There is a small catalogue of existing models at <a href=""https://cpi-catalog.000webhostapp.com/index.php"" target=""_blank"">https://cpi-catalog.000webhostapp.com/index.php</a> : as well as adding to these, you might want to enhance its online presentation. This will help guide the further development of continuous pi, and you will have the opportunity to be involved in this ongoing research project.<br/><br/>Potential modelling domains include: inter- and intracellular signalling; regulatory cascades; metabolic pathways; and the endocrine system.  Finding suitable examples will involve surveying existing process algebra models of biological systems, as well as searching repositories of biochemical reactions for new systems for which the continuous pi-calculus may be particularly suited.  Large international repositories like <em>BioModels</em> are a natural place to start, as they are easily accessible on the web and hold descriptions for tens of thousands of models of biological systems.  The project is open-ended, and will require a fair amount of self-directed research in the literature and online databases.<br/><br/></p>","Build a suite of computational models of biochemical systems in the Continuous pi-Calculus, a programming language for biomolecular modelling.",1,Variable,"Two or more descriptions of biological processes expressed in continuous pi, with tables and graphs of their behaviour obtained using the existing simulation tools.",6,0,f
2732,Computational modelling of multi-state biomolecules involved in memory,ug4,1987,2018-02-22 14:56:54+00,1,"<p><i>This project would be jointly supervised with <a href=""http://melaniestefan.net/"" target="""">Melanie Stefan</a> in the Centre for Integrative Physiology, and would be an excellent introduction to applying new techniques of biological modelling to a complex biological system.<br/></i></p><p>When we learn, synapses in our brain get stronger. This strengthening is mediated by Calcium influx into the neuron at the receiving end of the synapse and the subsequent activation of a protein called Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII regulates a number of postsynaptic proteins, ultimately leading to a change in the molecular composition of the synapse and the cellular microstructure around it (Lisman &amp; al., 2002). The regulation of CaMKII itself is fascinating: It is activated by another protein called Calmodulin (if Calmodulin is bound to Calcium), but it can also activate other instances of itself (by adding a phosphate group at a particular site) and thereby become Calmodulin-independent. This auto-activation is dependent on the structure of CaMKII, where six subunits form a ring, and each subunit in the ring can activate its neighbour. In addition, a CaMKII subunit can modify itself (by adding a phosphate group to another site) and thereby become inaccessible to calmodulin.<br/><br/>While we know a lot about the individual biochemical steps involved, a lot of questions remain to be answered: In particular, how do regulation and autoregulation events work together to regulate the overall function of an individual CaMKII molecule, or even a population of CaMKII molecules? This is an area where computational modelling can provide useful insights.<br/><br/>CaMKII is an example of a &#34;multi-state biomolecule&#34;, i.e. a molecule that can exist in a large number of possible, functionally different states. This results from combinatorial combinations of individual events or modifications that can happen (for instance, calmodulin binding and unbinding, phosphorylation at two different sites, conformational change, etc. - all of this for every subunit in a ring of six). Only in recent years have computational modelling techniques for biological applications caught up with this complexity. In particular, the advent of rule-based and particle-based modelling frameworks has made it possible, for the first time, to generate and explore detailed models of complex signalling molecules like CaMKII (Stefan &amp; al., 2014). Insights gained from modelling the 3D structure of CaMKII have been used to inform a model at the rule-based level (Stefan &amp; al. 2012).<br/><br/>In this project, you will use some of those modelling techniques to address an as yet unanswered question about CaMKII: Given the imbalance in concentrations, with CaMKII much more abundant than its activator calmodulin, how can a population of CaMKII molecules ever become activated at all, and does CaMKII autoregulation play a role in this context?</p>",To build a computational model of CaMKII using a rule-based modelling system.,1,2 - Moderate,A model of CaMKII in which there are two phosphorylation sites per subunit implemented in a rule-based language (e.g. Kappa or BNGL).

Nevertheless, as the first thing that a reader encounters, and as the data that is invariably captured in electronic data bases, the title assumes an importance that is only rarely explicitly realised by researchers publishing in these journals. A ‘good’ title enhances the chance that a paper is found and cited. A paper that is never found or cited means that the research it reports will never influence the work of others, and so is, ultimately, wasted. Many successful researchers know this, and therefore spend significant effort crafting the titles of their papers before submitting them to journals.

Here is Chimwemwe's original proposal, slightly edited to reflect changes as the project progressed:  <i>One of the stumbling blocks for novice programmers and early computer scientists when implementing software is a lack of intuition surrounding algorithms and elementary data structures that reside at the core of Computer Science. Every computer scientist should have a firm grasp of algorithms used for searching and sorting. In addition,  this should be complemented with a thorough understanding of common data structures such as stacks, queues, graphs and trees. Currently attempts have been made to visualise the processes algorithms undergo to perform common tasks. Unfortunately, these attempts display very low level representations of processes , often leaving users bewildered. Building intuition about an algorithm often firstly requires attaining a high level understanding of its basic operation.        Design and implement an application that will teach users about algorithms and data structures. It should display visual representations of algorithmic processes in an intuitive manner. The application should allow the user to construct inputs which can be given to algorithms and have the results subsequently displayed.  The app should also teach users about data structures. The application should be highly interactive allowing users to perform common operations on well known data structures. The aim of the project under proposal is to extend the software both to further algorithms and data structures as well as the nature of the information it provides.</i></p><p>The main desirable extension is to make the software available on a server through a web interface, however this would be the hard version of the project.  For the easy/moderate version  auto-scaling of the graphics can be added and some other algorithms.</p><p>If this project is undertaken by an MInf student then the first year can focus on the aspects described above and the second year on integrating this software with the software form another project &#34;Algorithms workbench for Inf2B&#34;.  At some stage the project would be rated as at least hard.</p><p><span>Please note that it is a precondition of this project that all the code is open source and the result is placed on a public repository such as GitHub.</span><br/></p>",Extend existing software (in Java) to help students inunderstandinbg algorithms.,1,Variable,"For the hard version, successful deplyment on a virtual server.

2713,"Better ski maps via domain-specific modelling: concrete syntax, design and automated layout",ug4,1322,2018-02-21 17:11:15+00,1,"<p>Ski resorts have multiple pistes, which skiers access using lifts. Traditional ski maps - see [1] for example - are topographical. They can be confusing to interpret, especially under stress or in poor conditions; for example, it can be difficult to answer questions like:<br/><br/>Q1) Can I reach this lift from that piste, or are they just geographically close? (This is particularly hard when the map is at small scale, which it typically is for large ski domains.)<br/><br/>Q2) In which direction does this piste run? (This is particularly a problem for short piste sections where neither end is a lift; sometimes this is disambiguated with arrows, but putting arrows on every piste is impractical in the traditional setting.)<br/><br/>Q3) How can I get from A to B satisfying a constraint such as &#34;nothing harder than a blue run&#34;?<br/><br/>For skiers who wish to stick to pistes, most of the topographical information is irrelevant, so we may contemplate better ways to display and exploit the relevant information. An obvious inspiration is the London Tube map, and this connection has been made in an artistic context (see reference [2]). It would be desirable to be able to use the same basic information about a ski resort to produce both types of map, and to use it in different ways. Therefore this project will start by defining a simple domain-specific modelling language (DSML) for ski resorts, in which the model elements are lifts, pistes etc. This part will be done in cooperation with any student(s) taking the related projects (with the obviously similar names): the DSML will serve as the interface between the software developed in the different projects.</p><p><br/><!--EndFragment-->The focus of this project is to develop a usable concrete syntax for the DSML, along with an automated layout algorithm. That is, design a representation of the modelled information so that, given a model in the DSML (a collection of model elements describing  all the lifts, pistes etc. for a particular resort, along with  appropriate information for each), a non-topographic map can be generated that allows a skier to answer Q1-Q3 more reliably.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/><!--StartFragment-->I would want the software produced in this project to be engineered carefully, well tested and documented and released under an open source licence, in order that it can be built on at a later date.<!--EndFragment--><br/><br/><br/></p>","Develop a domain-specific modelling language to describe the pistes and lifts in a ski domain, and use this as a basis for generating clear, non-topographic maps",1,2 - Moderate,"A domain-specific modelling language to describe the pistes and lifts in a ski domain has been developed, and from a model in this language, of the complexity of a medium-sized ski resort, clear, non-topographic maps of carefully considered design can be generated.",6,0,f

For example, some individuals with autism may have rigid preferences for food (e.g. eating only specific items) or everyday objects (e.g. using a particular type of shampoo). Routines around daily activities may become real rituals, followed in tiny detail. Consequently, sometimes minor changes such as moving from one activity to another or a slight change in daily routine can cause distress [2,3]. Other changes, such as going on holiday, moving house or changing school may be extremely challenging. </p><p>The goal of this project is to design and implement a technology-based tool to support children with autism overcome difficulties when changes occur. The tool is not expected to address all kinds of changes, but rather to focus on a specific category of changes.

2834,Interaction Capture in Virtual Reality Environments,ug4,1330,2018-02-25 23:34:31+00,1,"<p><br/>Machine learning techniques that can make use of a large set of motion capture are recently<br/>becoming powerful tools for synthesizing realistic human movements in virtual<br/>environments. For example, the phase-functioned neural network (PFNN) [1], can produce<br/>realstic interactions between the body and terrains or urban environments on-the-fly that<br/>follows the user instructions given by game-pads. The PFNN architecture provides a fast,<br/>compact and stable framework for interactively controlling characters. However, neural<br/>networks are good at interpolating but not at extrapolating, and especially can not reproduce<br/>actions that have not been learned. Thus, collecting a wide variation of motion capture data<br/>becomes the key issue when applying such a technique for arbitrary scenes.<br/>When applying such a technique to indoor scenes where the character needs to sit on chairs,<br/>pass through narrow corridors and open the door, and avoid obstacles and other people in<br/>the room, the data capture process becomes the bottleneck. In particular, we face the<br/>following three major challenges: First, the body markers might become invisible for the<br/>cameras if they are occluded by objects, so having complex environments seems to be<br/>infeasible. Second, some objects also are not always available due to the bulky sizes or<br/>might be quite costly. Third, the way we naturally move and interact is implicitly influenced<br/>by the ambience of the environment in which we are. Therefore, it often becomes<br/>cumbersome to set up proper environments inside the capture area in order to record motion<br/>data for different scenarios.</p><p>In this research, we propose a new method which eases and improves the process of motion<br/>capture by transforming these tasks to be performed in virtual reality rather than purely in<br/>the real world. The above mentioned issues can be overcome by using virtual reality in<br/>many situations. By only rendering virtual obstacles and virtual humans in the virtual<br/>world, we can capture realistic interactions between the human and objects and other<br/>humans without suffering from occlusions. The ambience of the environment can be easily<br/>switched by adjusting the textures and lighting conditions as well as the background objects.<br/>The motion capture setup for our proposed research is visualised in Fig. 1. The user operates<br/>in the real world while having the body markers attached to its body and wearing the HTC<br/>Vive headset (right image). The skeleton is then transformed from the real scene into a<br/>virtual scene using motion capture (left bottom image). For constructing the virtual scenes,<br/>we use the Unity3D graphics engine [2] which easily allows designing complex, detailed<br/>and high-resolution environments. In addition, a large collection of environments, furnitures<br/>and items for interaction can be obtained from the Unity3D Asset Store. The motion capture<br/>will be done by combining the VICON optical system and the Perception Neuron MoCap<br/>system [3], which also provides a ready-to-use plugin as integration for Unity3D. This is<br/>assumed to make the software development process very convenient. Inside the virtual<br/>scene, a camera is attached to the head joint of the character skeleton, which is then used to<br/>generate the view for the user in virtual reality (left top image). This view is finally returned<br/>to the HTC Vive headset of the operator in the real world, so it becomes possible to<br/>interactively navigate and perform actions inside the virtual world.<br/>The main advantages of this method are that arbitrary environments and ambient settings<br/>can be constructed quite easily, different objects for interaction can be directly used, and <br/></p><p>multi-sensory visual and auditory data can be recorded simultaneously while capturing the<br/>joint movements. Thus, the linking between user actions and the environment does not need<br/>to be fitted after the raw motion was captured, but can be recorded at the same time.<br/>In order to capture physical interactions that involve contacts, we will make use of props<br/>where the virtual objects will be aligned to. In addition, 3D printing can be used to generate<br/>some real-world objects of virtual models for easing interaction tasks.</p><p>The data collected data will be used to train a novel neural network architecture that can<br/>handle not only cyclic but also for rather acyclic movements. In summary, the results of this<br/>research can be used as a flexible method for capturing and creating procedural animations<br/>for collision-aware in-door and out-door movement with virtual characters, object<br/>manipulation and scene interaction in complex environments.<br/>We will also do data augmentation by making use of fast inverse kinematics techniques developed by a member<br/>in our group [4], by adapting the motion to objects with different geometry or characters<br/>with different proportion.<br/></p>",Collect human motion data in a virtual environment and apply it for constructing a model of a virtual human that walks and interacts with the environment.,1,3 - Hard,Collecting data and developing a human model that can interact with the environment.,6,0,f
2883,Learning Software Models to Predict Malicious Behaviours,ug4,1331,2018-03-04 11:31:36+00,1,"<p>Applications sometimes contain malicious code and it is a continuing challenge to detect bad applications before they are admitted to app stores like the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store.  Present tools for anomaly detection work using a mixture of methods, running apps in sandboxes to see if they do something suspicious, or examining sequences of instructions to look for errant behaviour.  Sandboxes can be defeated by apps which don't predictably behave badly or make a delay before doing so, and code inspection is fooled when new sequences of instructions are used.<br/></p><p>The idea of this project is to build a new static detection mechanism which uses a combination of structured models which characterise behaviour more abstractly, constructed from inspecting code or from using execution traces.  The intuition is that the notion of bad behaviour doesn't evolve as quickly as the form in which that behaviour is expressed: one piece of ransomware does pretty much the same as the next, although the way it is coded can look superficially very different.   Structured models that may be considered include include Markov chains and finite state automata; in recent research we have been comparing these with recurrent neural networks.<br/></p><p>The coding tools and languages used are less important than the methods.  Most existing tool and libraries are provided in Python.  A range of datasets and pre-existing tools will be provided.  One new dataset we may examine in this project is the &#34;SHERLOCK&#34; data described in the paper by Mirsky et al.<br/></p><p>Before expressing interest in this project, you should look at the two key reference papers and see if you can follow them, or believe you could gain a strong understanding given a minimal amount of further study.  <br/></p><p>An exact problem to tackle will be refined in the early stages of the project, depending on facilities available and the student's background.  This is why the difficulty rating is &#34;Variable&#34;.  The underlying data analysis tasks may not ultimately be too difficult, but understanding the context deeply, designing and planning the experiments and plugging together the right tooling will be challenging.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>PLEASE EXPRESS INTEREST EARLY TO JOIN A GROUP MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT.</b></p>","Using a combination of machine learning and formal models, build a classifier to decide if an Android application (or run of an application) is malicious",1,3 - Hard,"Constructing a classifer using the suggested techniques which achieves good results on test data (what ""good"" means depends on the context, the evaluation for the project will need to make a case for this).",6,0,f
2677,Android front end for benchmarks supporting parallel programming models,ug4,3842,2018-02-16 16:50:43+00,1,"<p>Over recent years GPUs have been recognised as powerful parallel computing engines not only for graphic processing but also for general purpose computing. This trend brought forth a range of parallel programming models such as OpenCL or CUDA which allow programmers to develop code independent of the execution device. An OpenCL program for example can be executed on CPU or GPU without changing the source code.</p><p>With increasing popularity and compute power of embedded devices such as smartphones, the demand for using parallel programming models in an embedded environment grew. Many recent studies evaluate how various embedded platforms handle OpenCL programs in terms of performance and energy efficiency[3,4]. To support this demand, a standard suite of benchmarks for embedded devices with the capabilities of using parallel programming models would be of great benefit. </p><p>The goal of this project is to take a well known and widely used benchmark suite which already supports parallel programming models and port it to an embedded Android device. For that purpose, existing benchmarks need to be cross-compiled for the ARM architecture and an Android application must be written to be used as an execution front-end. Once this step is completed, various optimisation strategies can be applied to improve energy consumption and performance of the OpenCL code on the given mobile platform, e.g. thread divergence, single vs. double precision, loop unrolling, tweaking the features of the OpenCL wrapper program, etc.</p><p></p><p>Examples of benchmark suites considered for this project are Parboil[1] and Rodinia[2].

2885,Rank Aggregation and related problems,ug4,1320,2018-03-04 16:33:41+00,1,"<p>We consider a problem which is familar to all program committee members; the problem of taking a collection of individual rankings of papers (one for each member of the committee), and merging these to obtain a global ranking which is as consistent as possible with the individual rankings. In this conference setting, it will usually be the case that each list only contains a subset of items (so is a &#34;partial ranking&#34;), and that each item only appears in a few of the lists. The &#34;Rank Aggregation&#34; problem has been studied in prior papers, mainly for the scenario of web rankings. Various measures have been considered by previous researchers.  I also have an idea of an alternative measure, when the target output is an Accept/Reject partition, not an overall ranking.</p><p>Two early references for Rank Aggregation are the papers of Dwork et al listed below. They were motivated by the scenario of web page rankings coming from different search engines, and the problem of combining those to obtain a good overall ranking. They discuss some typical measures used to calculate the quality of a global ranking.<br/>They define the K-distance between a full proposed ranking r on items {i_1, ..., i_n} and a partial ranking q on some subset of those items, as being the number of i, j pairs such that r(i)&lt; r(j) but q(i) &gt; q(j), and write this as K(r,q).</p><p>If we have a full global ranking r and a collection of (probably partial) input rankings q_1, ..., q_m, then the Kemeny score SK(r; q_1, ..., q_m) to be the sum of K(r, q_j) over all j. The goal, when presented with a collection of input rankings q_1, ..., q_m, is to compute a full ranking r which will minimise the value of SK(r; q_1, ..., q_m). This is described as the problem of computing the Kemeny optimal ranking, and is known to be NP-hard in two cases: either when (q_1, ..., q_m) consists of 4 or more &#34;full lists&#34;, or when it consists of a large number of partial lists. These details are presented in &#34;Rank Aggregation revisited&#34;, and experimental results are given in &#34;Rank Aggregation for the Web&#34;. There are many follow-up papers, many giving algorithms with approximation guarantees, and we will look at some of those.   </p><p></p><p>Another problem that could be investigated relates to an alternative measure to judge the quality of a Accept/Reject partition of the papers (with respect to the partial rankings of the reviewers).  This problem is connected to the (NP-hard and &#34;hard to approximate&#34;) problem of computing the Minimum directed cut of a given graph, subject to a bound on the size of the cut.  This means the Accept/Reject problem is NP-hard and also &#34;hard to approximate&#34; in the general case, but we might consider restricted subcases and/or an experimental study.</p><p><span>Apart from the papers listed below (and related publications) I also have two sets of notes, one by Bob Fisher, the other by myself, looking at alternative ways to measure the &#34;quality&#34; of a overall ranking (or a partition into Accept/Reject).  These give rise to different approaches. </span><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 14px;float: none;"">Theoretical directions that could be considered might be to study the problem of &#34;3 full lists&#34; to determine whether it is p-time or NP-hard (though I think this is quite a challenge), or to come up with a very simple algorithm and analyse it in the presence of &#34;limited errors&#34;, with the hope of proving a &#34;high probability&#34; of it reconstructing the true ranking.

The user submits a set of files (code) and the system proceeds to test all pairs for similarities (it is sophisticated and is not fooled by such things as changes of variable names or movement of blocks). In general this is a good way to bring to the user's attention possible collusion/copying. However it is subject to the problem that if each one of n types of similarities are not in themselves that unlikely then for a large class there is a reasonable probability that there will be a pair in which all n similarities appear. Since MOSS only looks at pairs the user of the system does not get to see that the single similarities are in fact not too surprising and so it is difficult to assess the significance of seeing them altogether in one pair of files. Going through the entire set of files manually to examine the evidence is extremely time consuming and usually not realistic.<br/></i></p><p><span><i>The major aim of this project is to produce a tool that automates much of the process with the user directing the system at which types of similarities to consider. Ideally the tool should also be able to carry out some form of normalisation of the input code to improve detection.

2714,Better ski maps via domain-specific modelling: modelling workbench for resort designers,ug4,1322,2018-02-21 17:18:31+00,1,"<p>Ski resorts have multiple pistes, which skiers access using lifts.

(This is particularly hard when the map is at small scale, which it typically is for large ski domains.)<br/><br/>Q2) In which direction does this piste run?

For example, the resort designer will want to maintain certain invariants such as &#34;no dead ends&#34; (the skier cannot reach any place in the resort from which there is nowhere to go) and perhaps &#34;no stranded beginners&#34; and others that would need careful formulation. Between seasons they may need to undertake such tasks as adding new runs, modifying the paths of old ones, changing lift types.

The design will be simple and modular, so that individual parts of the design can be easily extended or modified by future students, perhaps as an exercise in the Computer Design course. The system may make use of the attached ARM Cortex A9 dual-core host system, to act as a front-end to the Tiny RISC-V processor (which will of course be implemented within the FPGA fabric). The front end system will load programs into the target system's memory and run (or single-step) the target processor, displaying the results of each instruction. Due to the nature of the project, only students who have previous experience with the Zync-7010 from the 2017-18 Computer Design laboratory will be permitted to take this project. The project can be taken by more than one student, if demand is high. In that case, the project may be divided into components. </p>","To produce a laboratory exercise for the Computer Design course, based on the Tiny RISC-V instructon set, which allows students to experiment with different aspects of microprocessor design",2,2 - Moderate,A working Tiny RISC-V system.,6,0,f

2619,Enhancing the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture,ug4,2228,2018-02-05 21:04:44+00,1,"<p>The RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is an open ISA that is maintained by the RISC-V Foundation [1]. It has been designed to compete with current popular ISAs, such as those found in modern desktops, servers, and even embedded or mobile devices. The purpose of this project is to identify ways to enhance the performance of RISC-V. This will begin by benchmarking [2] the RISC-V ISA in comparison with existing ISAs that are widely used in industry, such as x86, ARM and perhaps others too, if time permits. The second step will be to identify some ways in which the RISC-V ISA could be enhanced with new instructions, to improve performance. The proposed enhancements will be evaluated by modifying an existing public-domain RISC-V compiler to target the new instructions, and re-running the benchmarks.<br/><br/>This is potentially an extensive project, and is suitable for 2-year MInf projects.<br/><br/></p>","To identify weaknesses in the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture, propose enhancements, and evaluate them through performance benchmarks",1,3 - Hard,"This project is in two main parts: (1) a comparative analysis of the RISC-V ISA, and (2) a set of properly-evaluated proposals for enhancing the RISC-V ISA.",6,0,f
2620,Fourier Transform Processor for Low-power Heterogeneous Systems,ug4,2228,2018-02-05 21:13:07+00,1,"<p>The goals of this project are to design, implement and evaluate a special-purpose stream processor for computing discrete Fourier transforms [1, 2]. Such a processor would be incorporated within a transform pipeline for broadband communications devices, where it could be programmed to perform forward or inverse DFT calculations, of varying power-of-two dimensions. The IDFT calculation could be capable of performing Hermitian-symmetric extension of the input array, in order to ensure real-valued outputs [3]. Arithmetic will be performed using fractional fixed-point types, scaled appropriately.The implementation will be a synthesizable Verilog model developed using a Xilinx Zync 7010 FPGA board, similar to those used in the INF3 Computer Design course. Several software libraries for FFT computation exist, and can be referred to during the project [4].</p>","To design, implement and evaluate a streaming processor for performing Fourier transforms.",1,2 - Moderate,A complete project will include a Verilog implementation of the FFT stream processor capable of both an FFT and an IFFT calculation.,6,0,f

2616,A model-counting approach to the repair of faulty representations,ug4,1358,2018-02-05 16:44:02+00,1,"<p>Formal representations of knowledge are required by autonomous agents to answer queries, make plans, communicate with other agents, interpret sensory data, etc. But these representations are often faulty, e.g., inconsistent or incomplete. This may be because: the source of data encoded within them is unreliable; the environment they represent changes over time; they are applied to a new task for which their coverage is inadequate; etc. Reformation is a technique, developed at Edinburgh, for detecting representational faults via reasoning failures and proposing repairs. Unfortunately, it proposes too many repairs and we need mechanisms for choosing between them. Additionally, representations may contain more than one fault. We prefer repairs that maximise the number of faults they simultaneously repair and minimising the number of new faults they introduce. This calls for assigning <i>degrees</i> of inconsistency and incompleteness to representations, so that we can compare rival repairs using these measures. </p><p></p><p>The maximum satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT) is the problem of determining the maximum number of clauses, of a given Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form, that can be made true by an assignment of truth values to the variables of the formula. There are efficient algorithms for MAX-SAT. It is one of a family of related algorithms that we can employ to measure the degrees of inconsistency and incompleteness that we need to compare rival repairs. </p><div><br/></div><div>The project will involve: (1) implementing algorithms to reformulate representations in Boolean formulae in CNF; (2) applying various SAT-based algorithms to these CNF formulae; (3) applying this to compare different representational repairs.  <br/><p><br/></p></div>","To apply a suite of SAT-based tools to assess the degrees of inconsistency and incompleteness of faulty knowledge representations and, hence, to choose between rival repairs.",1,4 - Very Hard,"An implementation of a system for comparing repairs to faulty representations using the techniques above, and an evaluation of this system on a test set.",6,0,f
2726,Implementation of hybrid automata,ug4,1349,2018-02-22 11:30:51+00,1,"<p>Hybrid systems (such as a thermostat) involve both discrete and continuous features. Hybrid automata have been introduced to model such systems. They are a formal model that combine finite state machines with continuously evolving variables. In this project the aim is to restrict attention to linear hybrid automata, where the continuous changes are constrained to be linear.This still covers a wide variety of hybrid systems. There are numerous aspects of linear hybrid automata that can be examined. Questions about state reachabilities constitute one concern; another is model checking using temporal logics (with constraints). It is left open exactly which features will be implemented.<br/></p>",To implement some decidable  features of linear hybrid automata and model some hybrid systems,4,Variable,A system implemented that exhibits the semantic behaviour of a linear hybrid automaton.,6,0,f
2658,The benefits of deforestation,ug4,1383,2018-02-15 19:08:05+00,1,"<p>When using a functional programming language, it is often natural to employ a compositional style that leads to the generation of a lot of intermediate data structures. &#34;Deforestation&#34; refers to a technique for transforming programs to remove such intermediate data structures, reducing run-time costs.The goal of this programs is to compare the theoretically-predicted optimisation gain of deforestation with what is achieved in practice by a modern compiler for a functional programming language. Measuring this will involve adding appropriate instrumentation to observe internal heap structures generated by the compiled program.A similar experiment was done in 1995 by Stefan Gruner at the University of Amsterdam, using a subset of the Miranda language and the FAST compiler. A secondary objective of this project is to see how the results achieved by a modern compiler for a functional language, probably GHC for Haskell, compares with Gruner's results.</p>","Compare the theoretically-predicted optimisation gain of ""deforestation"" techniques with what is actually achieved in practice, and compare with measurements made in 1995.",1,3 - Hard,"Implementation of instrumentation that enables measurement of intermediate heap structures generated by a compiled functional program, used for experiments on how these measurements compares with theoretically-predicted optimisation gains of deforestation.",6,0,f

2662,Computation in Physical Systems,ug4,3117,2018-02-16 08:51:54+00,1,"<p>A fundamental question regarding computation viewed as a physical phenomenon concerns the criteria under which a physical system can properly be said to implement an abstract formal procedure. Employing a 'simple mapping account' Putnam offers a proof of the thesis that every open physical system can be interpreted as the implementation of every finite state automaton. Such results have been used to argue that computation is not an intrinsic property of physical systems, but rather is purely observer-relative, and in turn that the computational theory of mind (CTM) is in principle trivial. In response, defenders of CTM have proposed additional constraints on the notion of implementation, <br/>including semantic, causal, mechanistic and counterfactual restrictions. There is a wide range of literature and competing views in this dispute, and plenty of theoretical terrain to explore.

2857,Developing an Intention Prediction Model using Kinematic-Dynamic Data for Human-Robot Collaborative Manipulation,ug4,3815,2018-03-02 09:19:28+00,1,"<p>A promising development in the future of robotics is the capability of humans and robots to work side by side [1]. When we examine this, we realize that robots have to be temporally or spatially separated from humans to ensure humans’ safety.  In this project, we venture to develop the required sensing system and intention/prediction models, to allow robots to collaboratively perform co-manipulation tasks with humans [2,3], as naturally as two humans would do. <br/></p><p>The first phase of the project concerns the collection of kinematic and interaction force data, similar to [4], during the execution of manipulation tasks. A human subject will perform specific manipulation tasks on a target object. An Xsens suit will capture relative kinematic data of the subject. The Vicon motion tracking system will be used to collect absolute kinematic data of specific parts of the subject, and the pose of the manipulated object. The ATI Force Torque sensors will be used to collect interaction forces between the subject and the manipulated object. The final dataset will consist of fused relative and absolute kinematic data, which are time-wise synchronized with the respective interaction force data.</p><p>The second phase concerns developing intention prediction models using the kinematic-force dataset.  Given kinematic and force interaction data of an agent manipulating an object alone or as a member of a dyad, the model should be able to predict the agents’ intended future actions. In other words, the model is a function that maps the state of the agent (current and previous kinematic-force measurements), to agent’s intended future actions with respect to the manipulation task. The development of the model will require: -Literature review on different intention prediction methods, -Feature extraction from sequential data, -Identify the most relevant features in the data, that are correlated to the particular co-manipulation setup, -Implementation of a baseline intention prediction method, based only on kinematic data [5]. -Ideally, implementation of method, that considers both kinematic and force data to predict agent’s intended actions. -Experimental evaluation of the methods developed on human-human co-manipulation scenarios with different goodness criteria.</p>","Assuming full observability of human agent’s action history in manipulation tasks, the goal is to predict agent’s future actions with respect to the manipulation tasks.",1,3 - Hard,"An integrated system, that allows to capture synchronizes kinematic and force data of a human, while performing a manipulation task.

2890,Build a platform for testing the usability of configuration languages,ug4,1351,2018-03-06 13:52:22+00,1,"<p><b>I am no longer accepting new registrations of interest as of Sunday 1st April for this project because I will be out of town part of the next week and will not be able to meet with new students.</b><br/></p><p>Configuring computer systems such as networks and desktops is very labor intensive, particularly for large organizations. A small group of people simply cannot manage all the computers in an organization individually. To handle this problem, configuration management tools, such as Puppet, were created so that an Information Technologist (IT) could manage many computers using a single configuration language.<br/><br/>Despite the introduction of these languages, system administration remains a labor intensive and expensive area. Expressing configuration through these new languages is not easy and the languages have many odd corner cases which make it challenging to predict how a given configuration statement will be evaluated. For example, Puppet is supposed to be declarative in nature, but contains many non-declarative aspects like the ability to run something on the command line. These confusions potentially make the system hard to use making an already labor intensive task more so.<br/><br/>In this project you will be an online game-type system that could be used to test the usability of different configuration languages. The system will need to allow a player to configure several computers on a network and evaluate if the configuration is correct. Similar to my firewall games projects, this project is highly creative in nature. It is expected that a student will bring their own ideas and direction to the project. It is up to the student what programming languages they wish to use to accomplish the project. Both Unity as well as other standard web languages like Ruby or PHP could work well. <br/></p><p>Students considering this project should visit the website below [1] and try playing some of the existing firewall games. While this project is conceptually different, the games should give a good idea of what a final product might look like.<br/></p><p>The project has a range of difficulty levels, but is marked hard because the concept behind it is non-obvious. At the most basic level, the student would implement a single level, demonstrate that it works on a technical level, and evaluate its usability with a small number of people. A medium level of difficulty would involve also conducting a small usability study with the target population of system administrators. An advanced student might use the built system to study how the different aspects of the Puppet language impact how people solve different configuration tasks. </p><p><b>MInf</b>: This project is suitable for MInf students. ​The student would spend the first year focused on game design and development. In the second year, they would focus on using the designed game to evaluate the usability of different configuration languages, or aspects of configuration languages. <br/></p><p><br/></p>",Build an online game-like enviornment where participants have to configure a network using a set language,1,4 - Very Hard,Build a system which allows a player to set policy for several computers and see the results of those settings.,6,0,f

This is due to clouds, sun movement, shadow movement, etc. Related to this is the change in the colour of surfaces due to rain, snow, paint, etc. Another complicating factor is slight camera movement arising from vibrations in the Forum and slight changes in the position of the  Forum as it warms up. The most complex factor, however, is the decision about what image content to include and what to omit. For example, if a worker is only seen at a given position in one frame, then they should probably be replaced with the background. But what about a piece of equipment that sits there for an hour, several hours or several days? And what if part of that equipment can move? And how to reconstruct background behind removed objects?<br/><br/>The initial goal of the project is to construct a reasonable time-lapsed video.However, there are bigger issues to explore here, as applicable to video data as a whole (e.g. surveillance video): 1) At what time scale should content be presented in a video? 2) How can activity with different time scales be detected and represented? 3) What makes for an attractive presentation?<br/><br/>A preliminary exploration of some of these ideas was undertaken by MSc student Reyes Ortiz: <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/DISSERTATIONS/msc_20080666.pdf"" target="""">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/DISSERTATIONS/msc_20080666.pdf</a><br/><br/>This project would probably use a more probabilistic approach, including Conditional Random Field, as well as for reconstructing missing content.</p><p>Example images can be seen at: <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/DTI/dtibuild.htm"" target="""">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/DTI/dtibuild.htm</a><br/></p><p><br/></p>",The project constructs a sensible time-lapse video of the Bayes building construction.,1,3 - Hard,"Two videos, one from each of the 2 video cameras.",6,0,f

2671,Parsing the LCFG configuration language,ug4,1340,2018-02-16 15:48:53+00,1,"<p>LCFG is a configuration tool which is used to configure the DICE systems, and many other machines in the University. LCFG was a forerunner of modern configuration tools, and the language it implements is now comparatively old. It has an informal syntax with an ad-hoc parser, and this makes it difficult to produce other tools which process the same language, or to extend or experiment with the language.<br/>The aim of this project is to create an explicit grammar for LCFG and to implement a prototype parser. This should form a basis on which to build further tools for processing configuration descriptions, and possibly identify ambiguities, or other problems with the language itself. The current implementation relies on tools such as the C preprocessor which support some features that are confusing and unnecessary in this context. The implemented grammar should therefore exclude some constructs which are currently permitted, and this may involve some investigation of how the language is actually used in real, live configurations.<br/>As well as learning something about the configuration of large systems, this will provide you with practical experience of specifying, processing and parsing languages using tools such as Antlr (see below).<br/></p>",Develop a grammar and associated parser for the LCFG configuration language,1,2 - Moderate,"A grammar and associated parser for the LCFG configuration language, together with an evaluation of this on real configuration examples.",6,0,f

The algorithm manipulates dynamically the contention configurations, in order to distribute the available bandwidth among service providers according to contracted shares.\r

A term in this calculus denotes a number, the problem is to find the number given a term. An algorithm was given by Mio and Simpson but they state that the worst case analysis leads to an &#34;abysmal&#34; bound. (However it seems very likely that the algorithm is good in practice.) An alternative algorithm was developed by Kalorkoti, the worst case here is single exponential (again the runtime is likely to be better in practice). The aim of this project is to implement the second approach with some timing studies as well as check the effect of some heuristics on the runtime of the algorithm.<br/></p>",Implement and evaluate one algorithm for solving Lukasiewicz mu-calculus terms.,1,3 - Hard,A complete implementation and timing studies of the main algorithm.,6,0,f

Goal of this project is to conceptualize and implement network measures and analytics into the Vistorian which allows for an interactive exploration of measures on these networks. Most important are dynamic measures, complementary to the network visualizations. The essential question is how can network measures driven an interactive exploration and how can an interactive exploration help the refinement and exploration of measures (when is density highest? When is the network most disconnected? How often does the density falls below a certain value, etc..)</span></p>",Implement visualization (interactive) visualization techniques,1,3 - Hard,Implement a set of 5-8 network measures and make their exploration interactive.,6,0,f

2737,Towards building the spectral theory of directed graphs,ug4,3553,2018-02-22 16:50:05+00,1,"<p>Spectral graph theory investigates the algebraic properties of matrices associated with graphs. Over the past decade, studies in spectral graph theory have successfully overcome fundamental bottlenecks faced by combinatorial algorithms, and have become a major research focus of theoretical computer science, machine learning, and network analysis. Most studies in spectral graph theory focus on undirected graphs, since the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of undirected graphs are real-valued. However, most graphs occurring in practice are directed, e.g., the Facebook graph and the Twitter network. Developing the spectral theory of directed graphs is of great importance both in theory and practice. </p><div><br/></div><div>In this project, we will study Hermitian matrix representation of directed graphs, and see to which extent classical results in algebraic properties of undirected graphs can be generated into the setting of directed graphs. </div><div><br/></div><div><i>Successful completion of the project could lead to a publishable result in algorithms and discrete mathematics. <br/></i><p><br/></p></div>",Investigate the power and limits of Hermitian matrices in studying directed graphs,1,4 - Very Hard,Develop new results about Hermitian matrix representation of directed graphs.,6,0,f

2755,On-line Forum for InfBASE,ug4,2097,2018-02-23 14:11:51+00,1,"<p>InfBASE is a student helpdesk where 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> year undergraduate students in the Edinburgh University School of Informatics can get support on core pre-honours courses [1]. The helpdesk is staffed by experienced tutors during the semester and Revision Weeks, every day between 11 am and 3 pm. The tutors have different expertise (i.e. with some of the core pre-honours courses) and provide their availability within the working hours by using the InfBASE website. Whenever they have questions, students need to check the availability of tutors with the needed expertise, and then drop in to ask them their questions.<b></b></p><p>Since it was first launched, experience with InfBASE has shown that the support provided by tutors is very valued by students. However, InfBASE suffers from some inefficiencies:</p><ul><li>The tutors’ workload is very variable, with little demand from students at the start of the semester and very high demand before coursework submissions and especially during Revision Weeks;</li><li>Some of the tutors’ effort is wasted on replying to the same question or discussing the same exercise with different students;</li><li>Students can work together as a study group and help each other during InfBASE, but this is under-exploited.</li></ul><p>To address these issues, but also increase the availability of InfBASE outside the 4 weekday hours, to more students, and potentially extend it for 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate students, this project proposes the development of an on-line forum for InfBASE. The forum could include:</p><ul><li>A question and answer (Q&amp;A) area where students will be able to post questions and get answers from InfBASE tutors, but also other students. Facilities such as tagging, searching, ranking and marking as favourite could also be made available. The forum would require InfBASE tutors to filter out incorrect or offensive student replies.</li><li>An area where resources (Word/PDF documents but also multimedia and audio/video and links to Lynda.com [2] online courses) could be uploaded by InfBASE tutors and other students.</li><li>A chat where students could discuss their questions with InfBASE tutors</li><li>Calendar facilities where students could request to book a face-to-face appointment or an on-line meeting with InfBASE tutors</li><li>An area where on-line meetings could be set up through integration with the university’s Blackboard Collaborate tool [3]</li><li>Channels for different years and on different topics</li></ul><p>To develop the InfBASE forum, we propose the following steps:</p><p></p><ol><li><!--StartFragment--><span style=""float: none;background-color: transparent;font-size: 14px;text-align: left;"">gathering requirements for the InfBASE forum from InfBASE tutors and students</span></li><li><p>reviewing existing forums used in education (e.g. for a Q&amp;A area, students could explore StackOverflow [4] and AnswerGarden [5])</p></li><li><p></p><p>closely involving tutors and students in the design of the InfBASE forum by using Value-Sensitive Design [6] and Participatory Design [7] methods</p><p></p></li><li><p></p><p></p><p>developing a prototype of the forum</p><p></p><p></p></li><li><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>performing a usability evaluation of the prototype with InfBASE tutors and students. </p><p></p><p><br/></p></li></ol>","Design, development and evaluation of an on-line forum for the InfBASE Informatics student support service",6,Variable,"For each student, the following deliverables:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 +",6,0,f

Many software and hardware solutions are currently being developed by both industry and research in order to make it faster, better and more energy efficient. One major area that has to be understood in detail for this effort are mobile workloads. What does the system I want to improve actually run? For this purpose interactive mobile benchmarks are needed that can be replayed over and over for various devices and system configurations.</p><p style=""font-size: 14px;"">In previous work[1] a methodology is introduced that greatly helps with analysing interactive mobile workloads on Android. This is done by capturing system events and video output of workloads running on an Android device. The collected data is then analysed offline in a second step and evaluated with the goal of improving user experience and energy efficiency of the device by tuning the CPU frequency governor. User input sequences of issued input and corresponding system responses are automatically detected by a video output analysis and provide valuable information on execution performance.</p><p style=""font-size: 14px;"">However, the presented tool is rudimentary in the way it is able to execute for different system configurations. The input replay and analysis of resulting screen output are decoupled and executed one after the other. For a more realistic replay scenario, however, a combined version is needed. In the desired version, the replay module would issues an input and while the system processes it, the video output analyser goes over the live video stream and detects when the corresponding system response has happened. It then signals the replay module, that the next input can be send.</p><p style=""font-size: 14px;""></p><p>This project comes with some challenges concerning the system setup. The replay currently runs from a Linux machine, while the video recording is done on a Windows machine. The device used for the experiment is a Qualcomm Dragonboard and would be provided for the project.

The student will then execute the chunks separately with the test cases (in a particular order given to them for improved instruction re-use) while storing the intermediate results. The project will need to implement a method for automatically identifying places to split the program in chunks and storing the intermediate results. Places of split identified should try to minimize the number of data dependencies between the splits. \r

test cases for large programs that do not fit in the instruction cache.,1,Challenging,The student will use 3 to 4 very large programs (> 30K lines of code)  for this evaluation. The implementation should split the large program in chunks and launch test execution on these chunks while storing intermediate results. The student should have compared time gains between executing all the test cases over the program split in chunks versus whole.,6,0,f

2761,Design of a dynamically controlled particle swarm algorithm,ug4,1333,2018-02-23 14:23:25+00,1,"<p>Metaheuristic algorithms aim at solving optimisation problems by a combination of random and local search, prior knowledge, and the accumulation of partial information acquired during run-time. The algorithms are usually featuring a population of sub-optimal solutions. In Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO [1])  each of these solutions is represented by a particle in the space of all solutions, and the dynamics of the particles determines the performance of the algorithm. In the project, principles like criticality [2], (an)isotropy and (in)homogeneity are to be controlled and tested in their effect on the behaviour of the algorithm. For this an existing version of the PSO algorithm is to be extended and tested of a number of standard benchmark functions.</p><p>If more than one student is assigned to this project, a similar study will be conduction with a different algorithm such as differential evolution (also easy) or ant colony optimisation (harder).<br/></p>","Design, testing and control of a dynamically controlled particle swarm algorithm",2,1 - Easy,A particle swarm algorithm with the described features is to be implemented and tested in a number of benchmark problems,6,0,f
2763,Sentinal : next generation annotating of video data.,ug4,1382,2018-02-23 14:42:35+00,1,Many tools already exist for the temporal annotation of events occurring in a video file. Typical examples will support playback of video at various speeds and allow the user to map key strokes to specific event classes than can then be annotated onto a timeline that follows the video. This works for a great many conditions but performs poorly when we also need to capture where in the image (i.e. spatially) an event is occurring.\r

,,,,,,We want to develop Sentinal to fill this gap. A simplest solution would allow a user to select a behaviour or event and tap onto the screen. More efficient methods would combine some basic tracking elements. This is probably best suited to a touchscreen / tablet app although we are happy to explore options more broadly.\r

2769,An interpreter for audited computation,ug4,3882,2018-02-23 15:46:35+00,1,"<p>Audited computation refers to software systems that are able to log and subsequently examine information about their computation history: this includes the origin of data, an explanation of the computation that produced it, whether it is confidential or not, etc.<br/>Such information can be used for various purposes: for scientific applications, knowing how experimental data was processed is crucial to improve trust; in security, we can use computation history to develop smart access control policies; for debugging purposes, knowing how wrong results were obtained allows us to spot and understand bugs more easily.<br/><br/>The traditional approach to audited computation is to store the computation log by means of ad-hoc instrumentation of a given program: this is error-prone and requires a lot of effort. There are however recent proposals of core functional languages with built-in logging and auditing, including the Calculus of Audited Units (CAU [1]) and the Provenance Inspection Calculus (PIC [2]), which provide auditing as a first class primitive without the need for ad hoc instrumentation.<br/><br/>Your task is to write a prototype implementation of a small functional language based on CAU or PIC, and provide an experimental evaluation of the additional computational cost of auditing; since we expect at least a linear slowdown under straightforward implementations, you will also investigate smarter evaluation techniques to mitigate it (the supervisor will be happy to discuss this topic: some ideas for CAU can be found at [3]).</p>","Implementation of an interpreter for a core functional language with history logging and auditing, and evaluation of its performance.",1,3 - Hard,"At a minimum, you will:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       +",6,0,f

2648,Cross-platform app development with ahead-of-time compilation,ug4,1324,2018-02-11 13:45:52+00,1,"<p>Recent estimates of smartphone OS share report that more than 99% of smartphones run either the Android or iOS operating systems.  Worldwide, Android devices outsell iOS devices in the ratio 80:20, but in some countries, such as the UK, the ratio is more like 50:50.  Inconveniently for app developers, the two platforms have entirely different software ecosystems, with Android offering Java or Kotlin for app development in Android Studio and iOS offering Objective-C or Swift for app development in Xcode.  Because these two entirely different software ecosystems are used, many apps which are available for both Android and iOS exist in two entirely different versions; one for iOS and one for Android.  This adds a significant increase in cost when developing a new app and presents an obvious software maintenance headache when new features are to be added to the app, requiring them to be implemented consistently both on the Android and iOS platforms.<br/><br/>An alternative approach is to use a mobile app SDK which supports both the Android and iOS platforms.  This allows only a single codebase to be used, making app development and maintenance easier.  Several such SDKs exist to support cross-platform development but many of these offer JavaScript as the implementation language, which brings with it many legacy problems of the JavaScript language.  Improved app performance and security can be achieved by selecting an SDK which uses a compiled programming language which is transpiled ahead-of-time into native code for multiple platforms.  One new offering in the cross-platform app development SDK market is Flutter, which supports the Dart programming language, allowing a single Dart source code project to be compiled for both Android and iOS.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness of the Flutter platform in practice by developing a Dart implementation of the location-based game project from the UG3 Large Practicals and comparing it with the direct Android implementation produced last year in terms of ease-of-development, code size and complexity, and robustness and performance of the end-product apps.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Note: </b>This project requires the use of a Mac platform to run Xcode.  The School of Informatics does not provide these so ​before applying for this project please ensure that you have a Mac to run Xcode.  An iPhone or Android phone would be useful, but are not essential.  You should have taken the Software Engineering Large Practical or the Computer Science Large Practical in UG3.</p>",To assess the effectiveness of a cross-platform SDK for Android and iOS development.,1,1 - Easy,A completed Dart app for a location-based game which is compared against the Android-only version which was developed for the Large Practicals last year.,6,0,f

Apple announced the Swift language as a supported language for iOS development in 2014 and Google announced Kotlin as a supported language for the Android platform in 2017.  The availability of these languages has meant that developers have access to programming languages which support a cleaner development style which allows them to write more concise and more reliable software.  <br/><br/>Two early-stage projects exist which offer the possibility to cross the development tracks to use Swift for Android development (the SCADE development platform) or Kotlin for iOS development (the Kotlin/Native/CLion project).  In the light of these possibilities, it could be a good idea to compare and contrast Kotlin and Swift as app development languages.  This project proposes to do this by creating a Swift version of the location-based game which was developed in Kotlin in the Computer Science Large Practical in UG3.  Having two separate implementations of this app will make it possible to compare the development experience in Kotlin and Swift in terms of the code quality of the two projects, noting aspects which were more difficult in one paradigm than the other, and to comment on the tool support which is provided in the two development paths.<br/><br/><br/><b>Note:</b> This project requires the use of a Mac platform to run Xcode.  The School of Informatics does not provide these so before applying for this project please ensure that you have a Mac to run Xcode.  An iPhone would be useful, but is not essential.  You should have taken the Computer Science Large Practical in UG3.<br/><br/></p>",To compare the Swift and Kotlin programming languages through the development of the same app on both platforms.,1,1 - Easy,A comparison between a Swift and a Kotlin implementation of a location-based game app.,6,0,f

Algorithms are given by means of pseudocode. It would be useful to have a system that enables students to implement algorithms in a language quite close to pseudocode and then enables them to experiment with runtime studies (perhaps also space used). The tool must make this process as convenient as possible thus encouraging experimentation. For example if a student wishes to compare quicksort with mergesort he/she should be able to express these in the course pseudocode and then ask for runtimes based on data created either by the student or the system. After that timings should be produced both in tabular form as well as plots. The system should also determine the constants involved in the standard upper bounds. A refinement would be to enable the student to ask for the timings of sections of the code so that the critical parts can be identified.</i><br/><br/>It is hoped that the project (which is currentluy in its third iteration) will be ported to a virtual server with a web interface during the current academic year (2017-18).  Whatever is the case there will be a range of desirable extensions that can be agreed between the student and supervisor.  As an example, the system has the capability of creating pdf reports which can then be incorporated by the student into a document that is edited so that notes and observations on experiments can be recorded.  It woudl eb desirable to have a lecturer account mode so that exercises/experiments can be suggested or set as part of assesment with a submit facility linked for the student answers.<br/></p><p>Please note that it is a precondition of this project that all the code is open source and the result is placed on a public repository such as GitHub.<br/></p>",Add significant new functionality to a tool that enables students to study the performance of algorithms.,1,3 - Hard,"A significant extension to the existing software (underlying algorithms, interface).",6,0,f

Such neural embeddings have been explored for users on social media. This project will create embeddings for newsworthy people and issues.<br/><br/>Embeddings for social media users are created with a variety of goals related to advertising, predicting likes, behaviour or political opinion. On the other hand, there is value to creating such representations of newsworthy people such politicians, celebrities, and business leaders while simultaneously also representing newsworthy issues in the same latent space. Such representations are of value to political and social scientists, economists and like. For example, an economist would be interested in knowing if two legislators are apriori positive about a particular issue to then ask if political logrolling could be involved on a bill.<br/><br/>The scope of this project is to learn such embeddings from a large news archive containing articles published by the New York Times over a 20 year period. The tasks involved are to identify and disambiguate newsworthy people over the entire archive (there is metadata to aid this step), find mentions of these people in the text, and extract their quotes as a proxy of their views. Further to that is extraction of the topic or news issue that is being spoken about and linking people to issues, creating a network structure. Then the task is to estimate embeddings for people and issues using a neural network model to explain the text as well as network structure.

2708,A Blockchain-based Lecture Attendance App,ug4,1324,2018-02-20 22:19:12+00,1,"<p>International students studying in the UK are required as a condition of their general student visa to prove that they are engaging with their degree programme and attending classes, lectures and tutorials as required. This includes participating in the requirements of the course including submitting assignments, attending meetings with tutors, and attending examinations. For some of these activities, attendance is recorded (for example, tutorials and examinations) whereas for others it is typically not (principally, lectures). It might be helpful to allow students to (optionally) record evidence of their attendance at lectures using a mobile phone app which records the user's location during the lecture times for their selected courses only (at other times the user's location is not recorded, for privacy reasons).<br/><br/>The GPS location recording technology on a smartphone is not accurate enough to determine which room in a building the device is in, but together with reverse geocoding it can be used at least to determine the user's location as a street address. While this cannot be used to prove that the user attended a lecture, it can at least be used to argue that they were in the lecture building, as opposed to somewhere else, thus providing some evidence of attendance and engagement. (No system of this kind can ever absolutely prove attendance beyond all doubt because it is after all only recording the position of the device, not the owner of the device, and in addition it is of course possible to spoof the GPS location of a device, but it provides more than the zero evidence of attendance which a student has at present.  A possible way to strengthen the evidence that the user is where the device is would be to use the fingerprint sensor of the device and require the user to authenticate themselves with a fingerprint at the start and the end of the lecture.) <br/><br/>The app should provide a secure login mechanism so that the location information records are associated with a named student.  The app would be configured with a copy of the Informatics timetable, which the user can use to identify the courses which they take. During the lecture times for those courses -- typically a 50 minute period -- the app records the user's location, and determines an average location over the lecture period, which is used to determine their location as an address, using reverse geocoding.  Other statistical information about this average location could also be recorded, such as the standard deviation, to give further proof of being at a fixed location for a fixed period of time.<br/><br/>This location information, and the identity of the user, is recorded in the blockchain to give a permanent, timestamped proof of the attendance data.  Anchoring the data in the blockchain provides compelling tamper-proof evidence that the lecture was attended at the advertised lecture time, and that this information has not been altered after the fact, because it is computationally infeasible to do so.  It should be possible to review the location records later, and show them to anyone who has the proper legal authority to ask for them.  <br/><br/>The app which records the location information could be implemented for an Android phone (using Java or Kotlin) or an iPhone (using Objective-C or Swift).  The blockchain could be accessed through the Tierion API to produce a Chainpoint timestamp proof, or it could be accessed via a different approach.<br/><br/><br/></p>",To produce a mobile phone app where lecture attendance information is stored in the blockchain.,1,2 - Moderate,The project will produce a smartphone app which allows lecture attendance to be recorded using blockchain technology.,6,0,f

2733,Parameter inference in dynamic models with noisy starting conditions,ug4,1987,2018-02-22 15:00:00+00,1,"<p>Systems biology models can be described using sets of chemical equations, which can be simulated using ordinary differential equations, or simulated stochastically. The models are governed by a potentially large number of free parameters, many of which are hard to determine experimentally. In principle, the free parameters may be fit by minimising the discrepancy of the model to data, but typically there are large uncertainties in parameters (Gutenkunst et al., 2007). However, there are some directions in parameter space in which there is small uncertainty, meaning that the model's behaviour depends crucially on a few directions in parameter space. Finding these directions allows the variability in the behaviour of the system to be predicted, even if the parameters cannot be known precisely.<br/><br/>The ultimate aim of this project is to apply a sloppy parameter analysis to a model of the interactions between calcium and calmodulin fit to calcium imaging data (Faas &amp; al, 2011). This would lead to a joint publication with Guido Faas. Two MSc students have worked on the project already. The first student learned how to run the simulations such that we could find the sloppy directions when compared to the fitted model presented by Faas &amp; al. (2011). The second student implemented the model of calcium uncaging and calcium fluorescence needed to fit with the fluorescent time series data supplied by Guido Faas. However, there were problems fitting the model to the data, and we discovered a fundamental problem that would be the focus of this project: At the start of each experiment, calcium is released from a caging molecule using a flash of light. However, it is not possible to control the amount of calcium released precisely. Thus the starting conditions of the ODEs describing the chemical reactions are unknown, making it difficult to fit each theoretical trace to the experimental trace. Should we introduce one &#34;nuisance&#34; parameter for each simulation? Is it possible to scale each trace?<br/><br/>If we can answer these questions, we will be able to run Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms to explore the shape of the parameter space. Sloppy analysis suggests it will be an ellipsoid, but it may have a more complex shape. Knowing the uncertainty in parameters might be able to resolve an experimental controversy over the value of some of the calcium-calmodulin binding parameters.<br/></p>",Understand how to infer parameters in dynamic models when the starting conditions are unknown,1,2 - Moderate,* A proposal for how to deal with the noisy starting conditions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +,6,0,f

2742,Streaming parallelism in Scala,ug4,1334,2018-02-23 09:03:20+00,1,"<p>Stream processing is a programming paradigm that allows easy representation of data processing pipelines.  Once specified, these pipelines can then be parallelised.  Several specialised languages have been developed that aim to make writing stream processing programs easy, providing abstractions that are appropriate to the problem.  However, this requires a new language to be used by developers.Scala is a functional programming language which is inherently compatible with Java.  It provides sufficient abstractions to allow streaming parallelism to be represented in a natural, native fashion.The goal of this project then is to implement streaming parallelism in Scala.  In itself, this is not enormously difficult.  However, to make parallelism efficient, pipeline elements must be load balanced.  Consider the case when one element is a bottleneck.  In this case its predecessor element will completely fill its queue and will stall, similarly successor elements will stall.  The bottleneck element could be replicated to increase throughput.  These load balancing issues apply to the whole programming graph, leading to difficult problems in managing the ideal balance.  An excellent implementation will attempt to approach this ideal balance.Must be very good at programming in Scala already.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Please, do not ask about this project if you are not already a proficient Scala programmer.</b></p><p>Do you know what <i>implicit</i> means in Scala?

2745,Shared Memory Parallel Programming Tutor,ug4,1327,2018-02-23 10:27:30+00,1,"<p>Shared memory (or &#34;multi-threaded&#34;) parallel programming can be hard to understand, for beginners and professionals alike. Simply executing a program doesn't always help much - there are often far more potential executions than can examined by any realistic testing framework. Before looking at the complexities of real languages, courses such as Parallel Programming Languages and Systems (PPLS) begin by introducing very simplified versions, which get to the heart of the underlying issues of atomicity of operations, thread interleaving, and memory consistency models. Even for very simple programs in very simple languages, the range of potential behaviours can be quite surprising. The aim of this project is to develop an interactive educational tool which will allow students to play, replay, rewind and generally interact with the simulated execution of such simple programs, in order to better understand their behaviour. A good place to start will be to look at the simple &#34;co, await, sequentially consistent&#34; programs introduced early in the PPLS course, and the simple underlying parallel machine model they assume. At the heart of the Tutor will be a simulator for such a system, with facilities to allow the user to control and investigate executions. This could be extended with a more game-like interface, which sets challenges for the student, with more sophisticated programming constructs, or with more complex (and realistic) memory consistency models.<br/><br/></p>","To build a GUI based tutoring application which helps students to understand the complexities of shared memory parallel programming, through interactive exploration.",1,Variable,"A basic level of completion would have a simple system implemented which allows exploration of concurrent threads of straight-line code, sequentially consistent semantics, and a simple ""await"" style synchronization mechanism.

2746,Parallel Task Scheduling Tutor,ug4,1327,2018-02-23 10:29:24+00,1,"<p>In parallel systems, task scheduling is the problem of deciding when and where to run the tasks which make up an overall application. There are a range of variants of the problem: for example, the tasks may all be known in advance, or they may emerge dynamically; the tasks may be independent, or they may have dependencies which constrain when they can execute; communication between tasks may be free, or expensive; the set of available processors may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. There are also a range of proposed algorithms and heuristics for the problem. The aim of this project is to build an educational Java application which allows the student to play with the task scheduling problem in an engaging and interactive way. For example, the student could be challenged to play the role of task scheduler, allocating to tasks to resources in simulated time, competing with standard algorithms, etc. Key features will be an intuitive and engaging interface, a range of difficulty levels and a range of problem variants.<br/></p>",To build a game-like Java application which allows students to explore the challenges inherent in scheduling interdependent tasks across a set of processors.,1,1 - Easy,"A basic level of completion would have at least one simple variant of the problem implemented, with a simple but appealing interface (eg drag and drop), and good feedback on success (or otherwise).

2747,Parallel Skeleton Library for DICE,ug4,1327,2018-02-23 10:30:43+00,1,"<p>Writing parallel programs which are correct and efficient is widely acknowledged to be a challenging task. The use of parallel algorithmic patterns (or “skeletons”) to abstract and simplify this challenge is growing in popularity. Each pattern captures the core structure of a class of parallel algorithms. The programmer specializes the pattern to a particular situation by writing some type definitions and sequential code, while the pre-defined pattern implementation handles the hard work of providing and optimizing the necessary parallel code. <br/><br/>While several skeleton based systems have been constructed, they tend to rely on quite complex software frameworks, and/or more modern versions of tools (eg compilers and libraries) than are provided in the School's standard DICE set-up. This makes them troublesome to use in teaching contexts, both because non-standard versions and packages must be made available and maintained, and because the corresponding complexities can be hard for students to understand and investigate.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to design and implement a &#34;DICE-friendly&#34; parallel skeleton library, which will allow students already familiar with C/C++ to investigate the world of skeletons without having to wrestle with the additional complexities of non-DICE friendly implementations.

Perhaps unsurprisingly it is enriched for proteins whose genes are linked to a wide range of human neurological conditions. However GWAS datasets from these conditions map less clearly onto the synaptic proteome often with weak or no significant enrichment. The synaptic proteome can be subdivided, on the basis of network topology  into clusters that each have enriched functional associations. We hypothesised that these topological communities form natural groups for gene set analysis and contain information not only about protein encoding genes with a mechanistic association with the phenotype but also with interaction partners whose role is important but less obvious. We combined 30 published synaptic proteomic studies from 2000 to date to obtain a list of 6500 molecules. We retrieved protein-protein interactions (PPIs) for combined list and built the most complete up-to-date PPI networks for presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. We then divided this proteome up into sub-communities on the basis of network topology. We analysed three large Genome Wide Associations Studies of genetic associations with human cognitive ability or educational attainment. A single community was found to have a significantly enriched association with educational attainment (n&gt;100,000) and this was then replicated across the other cohorts. The community contained half of the synaptic glutamate receptors. However, the glutamate receptors (as a group) are under strong evolutionary selection pressure and showed no significant association with the phenotype on Genome Wide Association analysis (GWAS). The majority of the signal in the community arose from other proteins in a dense subgraph closely linked to the glutamate receptors.&#34;</p><p>The project's aim will then be to use the results and the data the previous excerpt mentions in conjunction with existing publicly available datasets in order to investigate correlations between regional variations in protein expression in the human brain and psychiatric diseases. </p>",To examine how regional variations in protein expression in the human brain map onto psychiatric diseases,1,4 - Very Hard,Hypothesis testing: Statistical evaluation of whether brain expression profiles show regional specific enrichment for disease association - or not.,6,0,f

2766,Model-based classification of neurons in the retina,ug4,1344,2018-02-23 15:20:38+00,1,"<p>If we present a simple visual stimulus, e.g. a sequence of lights and darks, to a mouse retina, we observe that some retinal ganglion cells (RGCs, the output neurons in the retina) mostly respond to the light stimulus (ON cells), whereas others mostly respond to the dark stimulus (OFF cells). In addition, a range of different behaviours exist, such as cells responding to both dark and light stimuli (ON-OFF cells), with variable degrees of preference for either dark or light [1]. These are properties that can be better understood using a model-based approach, where simple filter models are fit to the recorded data [2].</p><p>It has recently been shown that there may be more than 30 different cell types in the mouse retina [3]. The project will address the question t what extent<font face=""inherit""> ganglion cells can be functionally classified based on their responses.

Despite the engineering control approach is deterministic and analytic, as demonstrated by the Boston Dynamics' new Atlas robot, it still lacks of the elegance and energetic efficiency.</p><p>A good way to develop a complex control system is to design a high-level objective at the task or performance level, then give the authority to the optimization process to figure out the details. This optimization process can by realized either by a model-based approach, ie using mathematical optimization tools to optimize the dynamics model; or by a model-free approach, using machine learning to build up a statistical model and control policies via trials.

Various simulation preorders are defined on Buchi automata. They under-approximate language inclusion, but are easier to compute. These notions of simulation (direct, delayed, fair) differ in their handling of acceptance conditions.These simulations are generalized by the addition of multiple pebbles, which lead to larger relations at the expense of higher computational effort (i.e., there is a trade-off). Simulations can be expressed by formulae in fixpoint logic (mu-calculus) and thus calculated symbolically by using binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to describe large sets.The task is to implement these algorithms in Java, using a standard BDD library and evaluate the performance of the algorithm.The project requires fluency in automata theory, and the ability to study advanced concepts in the literature like BDDs, multipebble simulations and fixpoint logics. <br/></p><p><br/></p>","Implement an algorithm to compute direct multipebble simulation symbolically with binary decision diagrams (BDDs) in Java, and evaluate its performance.",2,3 - Hard,Completion: Implementation of an algorithm for symbolic computation of direct multipebble simulation in Java.

2793,Developing a novel approach for combining output in multi-classifier systems,ug4,3631,2018-02-24 15:19:43+00,1,"<p>Systems involving multiple classifiers (also known as ensembles) have been widely used as a method of improving performance for <br/>classification tasks in many fields, including medicine and economy [1, 2, 3]. They rely on the principle that one can obtain superior performance to single classifier systems by combining the output of numerous (usually poorly) performing models. Much of the existing research focuses on which specific types of ensembles to use (Random Forrest, AdaBoost \&amp; Co.) [2], whilst there is comparatively little work on finding novel ways of combining the output of multiple classifiers. Recent attempts include using algorithms and techniques widely employed in different areas of mathematics and informatics, such as evolutionary algorithms [4] and game theory-based approaches [5]. The student will start by creating a methodology of testing performance of such systems, generating a baseline performance for different kinds of ensembles, using different kinds of combination performances. Next, the student will use analysis of the dataset to identify the weaknesses of the baseline approaches and they will develop a novel approach that addresses those weaknesses and improves performance. For instance, one widely used approach is based on the majority vote of the classifiers, and assigning different weights to each vote. A possible outcome would be creating a new system for assigning such weights. \newline \newline Possible continuations for Part 2 of the MInf project include developing new combining techniques from scratch and using more modern approaches to tailor feature selection and preprocessing to the strengths of different classifiers used in ensembles.<br/></p>",Improve performance of classifier ensembles by creating a new method to combine the output of the individual classifiers employed in the ensemble.,1,3 - Hard,"Creation of an improved model, building on existing approaches, or proof that changing the details of current approaches does not provide a reasonable improvement in performance.",6,1,f

2799,Probabilistic programs in Cognitive Science: A Comparison,ug4,1393,2018-02-24 18:40:08+00,1,"<p>In recent years, there has been an explosion of tools and languages for probabilistic inference (see http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home for examples). With this large and growing set of options, each of which uses a different combination of syntax and underlying inference methods, it's unclear which of them a new practitioner should use for a given problem.<br/><br/>This project is designed to make that decision easier, focusing on models and tasks that are relevant to computational cognitive science -- building probabilistic models to understand the human mind and solve difficult prediction and generalization problems. Specifically, the project aims to systematically compare at least three popular probabilistic programming languages (or libraries), along the dimensions of:<br/><br/>1. Speed, or computational efficiency.<br/>2. Parsimony: The number of lines or characters that are necessary to express a model.<br/>3. Accuracy: Different approaches to probabilistic inference lead to different kinds of approximations and errors.<br/></p><p>The ideal candidate for this project will be a skilled programmer who is familiar with different methods for probabilistic inference (e.g., variational inference and different approaches to Monte Carlo sampling), and comfortable learning new languages quickly.<br/><br/>Candidate languages (choosing 3-4):<br/><br/>* WebPPL: http://webppl.org<br/>* Stan: http://mc-stan.org/<br/>* Figaro: http://www.cra.com/figaro<br/>* Anglican: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/<br/>* PyMC: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc<br/><br/>The examples can be drawn from existing demonstrations or models, e.g., from:<br/><br/>* http://probmods.org/v2/<br/>* http://www.manning.com/pfeffer/<br/>* http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/examples/index.html<br/><br/><br/></p>","Compare at least three probabilistic modelling frameworks in terms of computational efficiency, parsimony and ease-of-use, and correctness, using several examples from computational cognitive sciences.",1,3 - Hard,"A complete project will take several examples written in one probabilistic programming language and implementing them in other languages in as straightforward a way as possible, keeping efficiency in mind.

2804,Detecting Paraphrases Based on Abstract Meaning Representation,ug4,1388,2018-02-24 22:55:29+00,1,"<p>Abstract meaning representation (AMR) parsing provides an attempt at semantic parsing that includes canonicalization.  This means that the AMR formalism attempts to abstract away from the surface form in which meaning is conveyed, and present the meaning of the sentence in a canoncialized form using a graph.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to see whether AMR can be used to detect paraphrase relations.  In a ``perfect world'' using AMR to test for a paraphrase relation of two sentences should be simple. It would require finding the two AMR parses for each of the sentences, and then checking whether they are identical. Since AMR is aimed at abstracting away from the surface form which is used to express meaning, two sentences should be paraphrases only if they have identical AMRs.<br/><br/>However, in practice, things are different. First, there are no known AMR parsers that really completely abstract away from meaning. For example, predicates which have interchangeable meaning use different concepts, and there are errors that exist because of the machine learning techniques that are used for learning the parsers from data. In addition, even using human annotations would not yield perfect AMRs, as the interannotator agreement reported in the literature for AMR is far from 100%.<br/><br/>Finally, meaning is often contexual, and it is not fully possible to determine the corresponding AMR parse just by looking at a given sentence. Entity mentions denote different entities in different contexts, and similarly predicates and nouns are ambiguous and depend on context.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to see whether AMR can somehow be ``softly'' used, for example, as features in a classifier, to detect paraphrase relations.<br/><br/>For more information about the AMR parser, see here: http://kinloch.inf.ed.ac.uk/amreager.html<br/></p>",development of an algorithm that detects paraphrases based on AMR,1,2 - Moderate,development of an algorithm for detecting paraphrases based on an AMR parser,6,0,f

One of the central problems regarding the chase procedure is all-instances termination, that is, given a set of existential rules R, decide whether the chase under R terminates, for every input database. It is known that this problem is, in general, undecidable [1]. However, it has been shown that for some special classes of existential rules, the above problem is decidable [2]. More precisely, if we focus on linear existential rules, a central class of existential rules with several applications, the problem is NL-complete (assuming predicates of bounded arity).

2840,Enhancing a theorem prover for cyber-physical systems,ug4,1363,2018-02-26 10:00:22+00,1,"<p>Cyber-physical systems are systems which involve computational elements interacting with the physical world in real time. Cyber-physical systems are ubiquitous in society today and our safety frequently depends on them. Examples include all kinds of transport systems (cars, boats, trains, planes, spacecraft), robots, chemical plants, and medical devices (e.g. heart pace-makers and life-support systems).There has been significant research interest recently in developing formal verification techniques than can be used to ensure safety and other desirable properties of cyber-physical systems.  In formal verification we mathematically prove system correctness, soensuring higher degrees of confidence in a system than if we use testing or simulation-based verification approaches. One formal verification approach involves deductive reasoning in a special calculus of rules that are tailored to the characteristics of cyber physical systems.  These rules allow one to reason about how some times the state of a cyber-physical system evolves continuously according to differential equations and other times switches between different modes. The aim of this project is to take aspects of work in a recently-completed Edinburgh PhD on enhancing the deductive rules [2,3] and implement them in a new interactive theorem prover KeYmaeraX [1] which is specifically designed for deductively verifying cyber-physical systems.  Once implemented, the project could explore further improvements to these rules. KeYmaeraX is implemented in Scala and makes extensive use of the Mathematica computer algebra system to provide essential automation in support of some of the deduction rules.

Each influence gives the player a set of legal actions. Each turn a player can claim to have any influence (whether or not they actually have that influence) and use one of their legal actions. Other players can at that point choose to challenge that player claiming they do not have that influence. If the player challenged does not have the card they claimed then they must reveal one of their influences other wise the challenger must reveal one of theirs. Players lose when both their influences are turned over.

,,,,,,"The goal of this project is to build a similar facility for Haskell, using a web browser as the graphical interface. It should be similar to the existing interactive facility at <a href=""https://www.haskell.org/"">haskell.org</a> (see where it says ""Type Haskell expressions in here""), but also provide graphical primitives, as for <a href=""https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/"">Dr Racket</a> (see the tutorial ""Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures""). The project may reuse the existing implementation from haskell.org, and combine it with an existing graphics library (adapted to produce graphics output in HTML).\r

The left half of the visual hemifield is initially and exclusively projected to the </span><font face=""inherit"">right hemisphere of the brain, and conversely for the right visual field and left hemisphere.

In this project you have the freedom to work on any aspect of network analysis according to your interest, and combine with ideas from your favourite subjects.<br/><br/>An honours project requires study of background material and some preliminary investigation to define exactly what to do in the project and how. In this case, we will cover these aspects in the course Social and Technological networks. Thus, you will be able to use your knowledge from the course as your background for your project. The course involves a small project, which will let you gain a better handle on your area of interest and relevant tools and techniques. <br/><br/>This structure of the project gives you an opportunity to make a more informed decision on the topic of your project.

A lightfield captures the spatio-direcional distribution of light [2]. Lightfield videos therefore record the variation of light energy across all three domains -- space, time and direction.  <span>As you might imagine, there are various ways to encode the high-dimensional data for efficient recording, storage, computation/processing and rendering.  </span></p><p>In this project, you will be provided access to a camera that is capable of capturing lightfields at 180 frames per second.

The data recorded by the lightfields is encoded using a scheme that is weakly specified by [1]. ​The goal of this project is two-fold:</p><p>1) Determining the encoding.

We are currently beta testing our iOS MVP and launching on the App Store in August 2018.</span><br/></p><p>This project was inspired by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"" target=""_blank"">Elo rating system</a> ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwx1zmJKq4"" target="""">fun description</a>), a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games, which has been adopted by World Chess Federation, commonly used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in video games, and was famously utilised for FaceMash in the film “The Social Network”. </p><p>Getting public engagement in ranking a list of answer options larger than 5 is hard, while engagement is much easier to obtain for multiple binary questions such as “This or That?”. The idea of ThisThat’s ranking process is to enable a fast and fair ranking of such long lists.</p><p>In the app any user can ask a ranking question with p&gt;2 poll answer options, where each respondent of the poll is asked to choose a preference out of two answer options. To frame this into Game-Theory one can interpret poll answer options as players, and each users' preference of a choice of two such players as zero-sum games. Assuming we can collect a lot of data of these pairwise comparison games we want a function that aggregates this data to give each player ratings which can be used to rank these poll answer options.</p><p>There are two core difficulties with this ranking process. First this aggregation function can not convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking without violating one or more fairness criteria of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem"" target=""_blank"">Arrow’s impossibility Theorem</a>. Second there are pC2 (number of players choose 2) type of games which can bring rise to a lot of pairwise comparison types. It isn’t always feasible to expect pC2 or more responses for a question. For instance if a user wants 15 pictures ranked to choose which 5 should go in an album then they have 15C2 = 105 type of pairwise comparisons which they could broadcast as binary questions. The difficult herein is trying to reduce the amount of necessary responses for valid statistics.</p><p>The goal of this project is for the student to address the two core difficulties; social choice theory and optimisation.

Some of the reasons for this include lifestyle/occupation differences between men and women. For example, lung and liver cancers are high in males due to smoking and alcohol. But for some, there is no clear reason why: For example, a type of brain tumour called glioblastoma has a 1.4:1 male to female incidence ratio; similarly, thyroid cancer is more prevalent in females. We hypothesize that there are host specific differences that could explain the disparity. For example, microglia (a type of immune cells in the brain) appear to be different molecularly in males and females. The goal of this project is to integrate data from cancer genomes across 30 different cancer types as well as data from single cell RNA-sequencing of cells from different organs, to learn genomics and clinical features that are different in males and females, filter out features are tissue independent differences and have trivial explnations such as lifestyle, body mass, hormones and then use machine learning to predict (and then validate) tumour types that should be different in men and women. <br/></p>",machine learning of cancer genomics data to predict factors that predict cancers for whose susceptibility should be different between males and females,1,3 - Hard,"Integrate published data, develop methodology to extract features, evaluate various deep learning/machine learning methods to predict succeptibility",6,1,f

A similar issue exists today, with platforms like EBay allowing users to digitally pay for physical items: a common solution is escrow, or having a trusted third party hold the funds until the user can confirm they received the purchased goods.<br/><br/>Escrow protocols for cryptocurrencies at the moment are similar to conventional escrow: either the market in question will hold the funds, or a third party service such as Escrow My Bits will mediate the transaction. The Lightning Network, a controversial payment protocol operating on top of the blockchain, claims to conceptually allow for off-chain transactions to be enforceable on-chain, but the project is still under development, and while the technology is live for simple transactions, there is no evidence of success.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate blockchain-based protocols that could serve as replacements for conventional escrow. Specifically, what problems need to be solved in order to use blockchain technology (specifically smart contracts) to imitate escrow?
