Simple project ranking forces an ordinal ordering on projects that I feel the same about. Grouping allows me to bucket the options more freely without having to place one over another. While simple scoring could achieve this effect, it&#39;s not very user-friendly, because it&#39;s hard to keep track of scores, and often I find myself going back to change the scores on projects I&#39;ve assigned before as I work through the projects list. Grouping allows projects to be progressively categorised as I work through the list, which is helpful. However, simple grouping does not represent well the granularity of sentiment, e.g. &quot;Separate from the project&#39;s I&#39;m okay with, I really want both projects A and B, but want A more than B.&quot; So a combination of grouping and scoring could be useful here -- group A &amp; B into &quot;I really want this project&quot;, and ""},""question2"":{""S"":""Yes, it was.""},""question5"":{""S"":""Nope""},""question4"":{""S"":""I experienced a ranking system that considers the top 5 choices and tries to give me my first choice.

I think the school needs to be more transparent. Ex. At the start they say they dont know what the outcome will be but in the middle before announcement of allocation they said that usually people would get first or second choice. Also i see that some projects are low in interested students and some have really high interested students, so ill say that it is gamification either way and that there is a way to get tge project i want.
