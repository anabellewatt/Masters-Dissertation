Simple project ranking forces an ordinal ordering on projects that I feel the same about. Grouping allows me to bucket the options more freely without having to place one over another. While simple scoring could achieve this effect, it&#39;s not very user-friendly, because it&#39;s hard to keep track of scores, and often I find myself going back to change the scores on projects I&#39;ve assigned before as I work through the projects list. Grouping allows projects to be progressively categorised as I work through the list, which is helpful. However, simple grouping does not represent well the granularity of sentiment, e.g. &quot;Separate from the project&#39;s I&#39;m okay with, I really want both projects A and B, but want A more than B.&quot; So a combination of grouping and scoring could be useful here -- group A &amp; B into &quot;I really want this project&quot;, and "
