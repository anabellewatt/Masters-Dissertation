            "S": "I had to gamify. I know it wasnt allowed but i had to. And it worked for me. I got the project i wanted. I think the school needs to be more transparent. Ex. At the start they say they dont know what the outcome will be but in the middle before announcement of allocation they said that usually people would get first or second choice. Also i see that some projects are low in interested students and some have really high interested students, so ill say that it is gamification either way and that there is a way to get tge project i want. As i intentionally only have 1 high interest project ranked number 1 and the second has low interest in students. So i dont have issues with the algorithm but nore like the social part of the process."

            "S": "Transparency on information sharing. Sharing the info about project allocation as early as possible like maybe 1st semester so people who want to propose project can do so (especially those who came here by company scholarship) because when given on second semester it is a bit too much. So maybe you can make it into a few parts. Also i think introducing the research groups and who will be supervising and what theirbexpertise is would be helpful (this is done at Uni of Birmingham). And make a filter that is easier to use and navigate."
