If one project fits in multiple buckets, you can put it in all of them or just the main one, but this should be clearly communicated, and the project supervisor should be the one to put a project in a bucket.\n\nIN terms of practically allocating projects, you can allow students to add weights both to buckets and the ranking of the projects. There are many ways of implementing such a weighting system, but any implementation that is chosen should be explained IN DETAIL to the students."

Opensource the algorithm and let students simulate things because at the end of the day it is not about what you prefer or you are qualified for, it is about the odds of what you can get.\n\nA VPN is required to access the platform unless EDUROAM is used. In fact, the platform itself feels outdated and lacks a lot of quality-of-life features. Direct communication with the supervisor through the platform is one. A better breakdown of the odds of getting the project based on other user preferences and outcome of suitability. And there could be many more.\n\nI was happy with the allocation result&#47;outcome but not with the process for the above-mentioned reasons."
